        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this exercise is to explain and compute the Hamiltonian and Eulerian Paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's use a day-to-day example to explain the concepts of Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths and their connection through the line graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Eulerian Path\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are taking a walk in your neighborhood and want to pass through every street exactly once and end up where you started. To do this, you need to ensure a few things:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your neighborhood must be connected, meaning you can reach any street from any other street.\n",
        "Most intersections (vertices) must have an even number of streets leading into them. However, it's okay if a couple of intersections have an odd number of streets, as long as you start and finish at one of them.\n",
        "In this scenario, the streets represent edges, and the intersections represent vertices of a graph. Finding a path that fulfills these conditions is like finding an Eulerian path in your neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hamiltonian Path\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's consider a different situation. You have a list of locations you want to visit, like your favorite park, a coffee shop, and a library, and you want to visit each location exactly once and then return home. It's not as easy to determine if such a path exists because there are no specific rules like the Eulerian path conditions. This is similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, which can be quite challenging to solve in a general scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Connection through Line Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's connect these two concepts through the line graph. Imagine you create a new map of your neighborhood where streets are represented by points (vertices), and if two streets share an intersection, you draw an edge between the corresponding points in the map. This map is the line graph of your neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you find an Eulerian path on your neighborhood streets (the original graph), then, in the line graph, there will be a Hamiltonian path. This means the path you walked on the streets can be represented as a path through the points (vertices) in the line graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, if there is a Hamiltonian path in the line graph (the map of street connections), it implies that you can find an Eulerian path in your neighborhood streets. This is because the Hamiltonian path in the line graph corresponds to a specific route on your neighborhood streets.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the connection is like this: finding an Eulerian path in your neighborhood streets (original graph) is related to finding a Hamiltonian path in the map of street connections (line graph), and vice versa. The line graph helps to bridge the concepts of traversing edges in the original graph and visiting vertices in the derived graph, just as in our day-to-day example.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Illustration of this connection by building small random graphs with networkx and finding eulerian or hamiltonian paths in the obtained graphs / line graphs.\n",
